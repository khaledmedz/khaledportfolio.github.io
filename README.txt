
## HTML5 and CSS3 Template Modification

The design and layout of this portfolio website are based on an HTML5 and CSS3 template that I modified to suit my preferences. 

- **Template Source**: The original HTML5 and CSS3 template I used as a starting point can be found  [here](https://html5up.net/massively).

- **Customization**: I customized the template's HTML and CSS to create a unique and personalized look for my portfolio. 

- **Responsive Design**: Ensuring a responsive design was a crucial aspect of the modification. The website is designed to adapt and display optimally on various devices and screen sizes.

- **Accessibility**: Accessibility is a priority, and I have made sure that the website meets the necessary accessibility standards, making it usable for a wider audience.
