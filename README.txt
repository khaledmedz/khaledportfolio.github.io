## CSS Template Modification

The design and layout of this portfolio website are based on a CSS template that I modified to suit my preferences. The following are some key points regarding the template modification:

- **Template Source**: The original CSS template I used as a starting point can be found [here](https://html5up.net/massively).

- **Customization**: I customized the template's CSS to create a unique and personalized look for my portfolio. 

- **Responsive Design**: Ensuring a responsive design was a crucial aspect of the modification. The website is designed to adapt and display optimally on various devices and screen sizes.


- **Accessibility**: Accessibility is a priority, and I have made sure that the website meets the necessary accessibility standards, making it usable for a wider audience.
